# Minecraft Tic Tac Toe datapack v.1.0
## Updates
So far I haven't done anything, but I am planning to do some big updates in the future!  

## Installation
1. Go into your world folder > datapacks.

2. Git clone there

## Rules:
1. There have to be exactly 2 players in a game

2. Only 1 game can be played at a time

3. Game version - 1.15.2

## Game
### Start

Go back in your world and if this pops up:

press **[start]**! If it doesn't, do ``/reload``.

When you start the game, it creates a 3x3 field made of Light Gray Concrete under the person who started the game. Then a message like this should show up:

The 2nd player must press **-[JOIN GAME]-**. Now the actual game begins. Each player's hotbar is replaced with only Light Gray Concrete. First is player1 everytime. The colors of the players go as shown:

| Player  | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Player1 | blue  |
| PLayer2 | red   |

### How to play

When you throw a block out of your hotbar, it indicates where you want to place your colored block. For instance when you throw out the first block in your hotbar, it will color the block with digit 1 in the field. Here is how every hotbar represents a block(hotbar > block):

## Troubleshooting
If you don't see the text for start, credits and stop do ``/reload``. If you still don't see it try doing 

``/datapack enable "file/TicTacToe-v1.0"``

If you still can't get something to work, hit me up on discord - yo_gotinia#1523.
